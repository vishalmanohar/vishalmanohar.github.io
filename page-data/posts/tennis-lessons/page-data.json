I had donned a coachee role after a long time and one of the first things that came to mind when it started was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The coach makes such a big difference. The individual attention and personal feedback and suggestions are helping immensely. Why don’t we have a coach for professional work?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ‘coachee’ experience triggered some perspectives:</p>\n<p>It was a humbling (and fumbling) experience taking the first steps to a game I hadn’t played before. I really appreciated the patience shown by the coaches to correct the mistakes step by step until a stroke was improved.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is easy to forget how difficult it was the first time once you gain a lot of experience and not show the same empathy when you become a mentor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The coach seemed to know that you should not overwhelm someone with too much feedback and gave it incrementally and at the right time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a lead or mentor, it is our job is to give feedback to help someone improve. But the timing and tone are as important as the objectivity of the feedback.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The junior coach would sometimes keep repeating the same feedback to no avail at times — “bend your knees or turn your upper body more to play a shot. You need to get into position quickly so that you have enough time. You need to improve footwork”. The senior coach would watch and later prescribe warm-up routines and stretches to enhance flexibility and footwork or improve stamina.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a mentor, you need to listen carefully and look at things from the perspective of the mentee — only then can you connect to the root cause and solve the problem effectively.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a beginner in the game, I would initially try to quickly wrap up warm-up exercises so I could get to the court and start playing. However, I would notice senior players who would do 1 hour of intensive warm-up and exercise before even picking up the racquet. And when you saw them playing in the court later, it was clear why that prep work is essential.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Foundations matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>True learning is not just about learning the latest cool framework but also having a deep understanding of how things work and the basics like data structures, algorithms, compiler construction — We might not need this 90% of the time but that 10% use case where you have to build an abstraction, these foundational skills make a huge difference.\nI later remembered this article I had read many years back — <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/personal-best\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">“Top athletes and singers have coaches. Should you?”</a> by Atul Gawande.</p>\n<p>Now, a personal coach in the professional realm in software engineering might be a tall order. But luckily in this field, there are several ways one can get guidance when you cannot arrange a personal coach.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pair program with seniors in the team or company</li>\n<li>If your company has a mentorship program, take advantage of it and meet your mentor every month to discuss</li>\n<li>Read code from top quality open source projects.
