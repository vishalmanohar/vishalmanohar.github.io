Lots of lives were lost. People were in lockdown for many months and doom scrolling.\nYet, somehow, humanity gathered itself, organised, not only invented a vaccine but also magically got it delivered to billions of humans around the world. We survived and some of us working in tech actually thrived.</p>\n<p>Covid put a lot of digital tech in focus. Lot of money was thrown around. Tech became super hot. And then it melted.</p>\n<p>Offline took over again. People realised the valuations were way out of propotions. Meanwhile, interest rates started climbing and put pressure on margins.</p>\n<p>So, there was a correction and we transitioned quitely from “Work From Home Forever”, “The Great Resignation”,  “Quiet Quitting” etc to layoffs and “Back To Office - Whether you like it or not”.</p>\n<p>But something was brewing on the side which everyone first ignored , then laughed about and then it became so good that you hope it doesn’t fight you.</p>\n<p>Yes, the AIs, the LLMs have gotten so good that if you aren’t using them OR building on them, then you are going to be on the wrong side.</p>\n<p>But let’s cut to the chase.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-is-knowledge-work-heck-our-lives-going-to-change\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-is-knowledge-work-heck-our-lives-going-to-change\" aria-label=\"how is knowledge work heck our lives going to change permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How is knowledge work, heck, our lives going to change?</h3>\n<p>LLMs are forcing us to deeply introspect the nature of our work and what it is we really do.

Right now atleast, it feels like a calm before the storm, or the next big AI model.\nIt maybe that AI scaling has hit a wall.</p>\n<p>For now, the focus has shifted to applications <a href=\"https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Generative AI’s Act Two</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the interesting ways to look at it is through the lens of humans “in the loop”, “on the loop”  and “off the loop”.</p>\n<p>AI as a co-pilot is going to grow. It can become more effective, more personalised as a “Pair Programmer” than even a human.\nThat is going to have far reaching consequences to jobs as we know it.</p>\n<p>Entry level SWE are already <a href=\"https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/llms-eat-entry-level-swes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">feeling the heat</a>.</p>\n<p>If we look at how autopilot tech on planes change pilot training and skill requirements is any indication, knowledge work that <em>needs</em> a human in the loop will also change similarly with AI copilots.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/6702bc9c-844c-8012-90bf-08f43e00c39f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://chatgpt.com/share/6702bc9c-844c-8012-90bf-08f43e00c39f</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While autopilot has changed pilot training by shifting some focus to system management and human-machine interaction, the fundamentals of flying—manual control, situational awareness, and emergency response—remain critical. The role of pilots has evolved into more of a systems manager, but their responsibility for the safety of the flight is as crucial as ever. Autopilot is a tool, not a replacement, and pilot training ensures that aviators are ready to handle both automated and manual flight situations effectively.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that can’t be a bad thing.
